[Google Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/) allows you to monetize your website by displaying ads.

Nuxt Scripts provides a `useScriptGoogleAdsense` composable and a headless `ScriptGoogleAdsense` component to interact with the Google Adsense.

## ScriptGoogleAdsense

The `ScriptGoogleAdsense` component is a wrapper around the `useScriptGoogleAdsense` composable. It provides a simple way to embed ads in your Nuxt app.

```vue
<template>
  <ScriptGoogleAdsense
    data-ad-client="ca-pub-..."
    data-ad-slot="..."
  />
</template>
```

### Handling Ad-blockers

You can use these hooks to add a fallback when the Google Adsense script is blocked.

```vue
<template>
  <ScriptGoogleAdsense
    data-ad-client="ca-pub-..."
    data-ad-slot="..."
  >
    <template #error>
      <!-- Fallback ad -->
      Please support us by disabling your ad blocker.
    </template>
  </ScriptGoogleAdsense>
</template>
```

### Props

The `ScriptGoogleAdsense` component supports all props that Google Adsense supports on the `<ins>` tag. See the [Ad tags documentation](https://developers.google.com/adsense/platforms/transparent/ad-tags) for more information.

At a minimum you must provide the following tags:
- `data-ad-client`: The Google Adsense ID.
- `data-ad-slot`: The slot ID.

Nuxt Scripts exposes the following additional props:
- `trigger`: The trigger event to load the script. Default is `undefined`. See [Element Event Triggers](/docs/guides/script-triggers#element-event-triggers) for more information.

### Slots

There are a number of slots mapped to the script status that you can use to customize the ad experience.

- **error**:
  The slot is used to display content when the ad fails to load.

- **awaitingLoad**
  The slot is used to display content before the ad script is loaded.

- **loaded**
  The slot is used to display content after the ad script is loaded.

- **loading**
  The slot is used to display content while the ad script is loading.

```vue
<template>
  <ScriptGoogleAdsense
    serve="..."
    placement="..."
  >
    <template #awaitingLoad>
      Loading ads...
    </template>
  </ScriptGoogleAdsense>
</template>
```

## useScriptGoogleAdsense

The `useScriptGoogleAdsense` composable lets you have fine-grain control over the Google Adsense script.

```ts
export function useScriptGoogleAdsense<T extends GoogleAdsenseApi>(_options?: GoogleAdsenseInput) {}
```

Please follow the [Registry Scripts](/docs/guides/registry-scripts) guide to learn more about advanced usage.

### GoogleAdsenseApi

```ts
export interface GoogleAdsenseApi {
  adsbygoogle: any[] & { loaded: boolean }
}
```

### GoogleAdsenseInput

```ts
export const GoogleAdsenseOptions = object({
  /**
   * The Google Adsense ID.
   */
  client: optional(string()),
})
```
