[Stripe](https://stripe.com) is a popular payment gateway that allows you to accept payments online.

Nuxt Scripts provides two Stripe features:
- `useScriptStripe` composable which gives loads in the Stripe SDK and provides a way to interact with it programmatically.
- `ScriptStripePricingTable` component that allows you to embed a [Stripe Pricing Table](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table) on your site.

## ScriptStripePricingTable

The `ScriptStripePricingTable` component allows you to embed a [Stripe Pricing Table](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table) on your site
in an optimized way.

To improve performance it will load the table when it's visible using the [Element Event Triggers](/docs/guides/script-triggers#element-event-triggers).

::callout
You'll need to create your own [Pricing Table](https://dashboard.stripe.com/pricing-tables) before proceeding.

### Demo

::code-group

:stripe-demo{label="Output"}

```vue [Input]
<template>
  <ScriptStripePricingTable
    pricing-table-id="prctbl_1PD0MMEclFNgdHcR8t0Jop2H"
    publishable-key="pk_live_51OhXSKEclFNgdHcRNi5xBjBClxsA0alYgt6NzBwUZ880pLG88rYSCYPQqpzM3TedzNYu5g2AynKiPI5QVLYSorLJ002iD4VZIB"
  />
</template>
```

### Props

The `ScriptStripePricingTable` component accepts the following props:

- `trigger`: The trigger event to load the Stripe. Default is `mouseover`. See [Element Event Triggers](/docs/guides/script-triggers#element-event-triggers) for more information.
- `pricing-table-id`: The ID of the Pricing Table you created in the Stripe Dashboard.
- `publishable-key`: Your Stripe publishable key.
- `client-reference-id`: A unique identifier for the client.
- `customer-email`: The email of the customer.
- `customer-session-client-secret`: The client secret of the customer session.

### Events

The `ScriptStripePricingTable` component emits a single `ready` event when the pricing table is loaded.

```ts
const emits = defineEmits<{
  ready: []
}>()
```

### Slots

The component provides minimal UI by default, only enough to be functional and accessible. There are a number of slots for you to customize the maps however you like.

**default**

The default slot is used to display content that will always be visible.

**awaitingLoad**

The slot is used to display content while the Stripe is loading.

**loading**

The slot is used to display content while the Stripe is loading.

## useScriptStripe

The `useScriptStripe` composable lets you have fine-grain control over the Stripe SDK. It provides a way to load the Stripe SDK and interact with it programmatically.

```ts
export function useScriptStripe<T extends StripeApi>(_options?: StripeInput) {}
```

Please follow the [Registry Scripts](/docs/guides/registry-scripts) guide to learn more about advanced usage.

### Options

```ts
export const StripeOptions = object({
  advancedFraudSignals: optional(boolean()),
})
```

### StripeApi

```ts
export interface StripeApi {
  Stripe: stripe.StripeStatic
}
```

## Example

Loading the Stripe SDK and using it to create a payment element.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const paymentEl = ref(null)
const { $script } = useScriptStripe()
onMounted(() => {
  $script.then(({ Stripe }) => {
    const stripe = Stripe('YOUR_STRIPE_KEY')
    const elements = stripe.elements()
    const paymentElement = elements.create('payment', { /* pass keys */})
    paymentElement.mount(paymentEl.value)
  })
})
</script>

<template>
  <div ref="paymentEl" />
</template>
```
