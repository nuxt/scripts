Load a script once consent has been provided either through a resolvable `consent` or calling the `accept` method.

## Signature

```ts
function useConsentScriptTrigger(options?: ConsentScriptTriggerOptions): UseConsentScriptTriggerApi {}
```

## Arguments

```ts
export interface ConsentScriptTriggerOptions {
  /**
   * An optional reactive (or promise) reference to the consent state. You can use this to accept the consent for scripts
   * instead of using the accept() method.
   */
  consent?: Promise<boolean | void> | Ref<boolean> | ComputedRef<boolean> | boolean
  /**
   * Should the script be loaded on the `requestIdleCallback` callback. This is useful for non-essential scripts that
   * have already been consented to be loaded.
   */
  postConsentTrigger?: NuxtUseScriptOptions['trigger']
}
```

## Returns

A extended promise api with an `accept` method to accept the consent and load the script.

```ts
interface UseConsentScriptTriggerApi extends Promise<void> {
  /**
   * A function that can be called to accept the consent and load the script.
   */
  accept: () => void
}
```

## Example

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup>
const trigger = useConsentScriptTrigger()
useScript('https://example.com/script.js', { trigger })
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="trigger.accept">
    Accept Consent
  </button>
</template>
```
