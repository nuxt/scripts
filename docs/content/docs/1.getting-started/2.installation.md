-- This is a work in progress --

## Quick Start

To get started, simply run:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add @nuxt/scripts
```

To start using Nuxt Scripts, you can use the [useScript](https://unhead.unjs.io/usage/composables/use-script) composable to load your third-party scripts.

### Confetti Preview

If you want to get a preview for how the module works, you can use the registry script for [JS Confetti](https://github.com/loonywizard/js-confetti).

```ts
// place anywhere, just works in SSR
const { addConfetti } = useScriptConfetti({ version: 'latest' }, {
  trigger: 'onNuxtReady' // loads when the browser is idle
})
// will be executated on the client when the script is loaded
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
```
