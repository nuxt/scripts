## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to load the [js-confetti](https://github.com/loonywizard/js-confetti) script using the Nuxt Scripts module.

You'll learn about the following:
- What the `useScriptNpm` registry script is.
- How to load the `js-confetti` script using it.
- Adding types to loaded scripts.
- Using proxied functions to call the script.

## Background on useScriptNpm

To load the script, we'll be using the [useScriptNpm](/scripts/utility/npm).

This is a [registry script](/scripts), a supported
third-party integration built on top of the
[useScript](/docs/api/use-script) composable that allows you to load scripts from NPM.

When working with NPM files, you'd typically include them as a node_module dependency in the `package.json` file. However,
optimizing the script loading of these scripts can be difficult, requiring a dynamic import of the module from a separate chunk and
loading it only when needed. It also slows down your build as the module needs to be transpiled.

The `useScriptNpm` registry script abstracts this process, allowing you to load scripts that have been exported as immediately invokable functions,
with a single line of code .

In many instances it will still make more sense to include the script as a dependency in the `package.json` file, but for scripts that are not used often or
are not critical to the application, this can be a great alternative.

To begin with we can think of using this script as an alternative to the `useHead` composable. You can see an example of the abstraction
layers in the following code sample.

::code-group

```ts [Registry Script useScriptNpm]
useScriptNpm({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  version: '0.12.0',
})
```

```ts [useScript]
useScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-confetti@0.12.0/dist/js-confetti.browser.js')
```

```ts [useHead]
useHead({
  scripts: [
    { src: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-confetti@latest/dist/js-confetti.browser.js' }
  ]
})
```

::

### Loading the script

Within your one of your components, you'll want to load the script. You can do this by using the `useScriptNpm` registry script.

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useScriptNpm({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  version: '0.12.0',
})
</script>
```

If you check your browser requests, you should see the script being loaded.

### Resolving the third-party script API

Now that the script is loaded, you can use it in your component. To do so we need to tell the underlying API how to use the script, for this we can
leverage the [use](/docs/api/use-script#use) function.

This function is only called on the client-side and is used to resolve the third-party script.

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
useScriptNpm({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  version: '0.12.0',
  // tell useScript how to resolve the third-party script
  use: () => typeof window.JSConfetti !== 'undefined' && new window.JSConfetti()
})
</script>
```

### Using the third-party script API

Now that we have a way to resolve the third-party script API, we can start using it.

To use the API we have a couple of options proxied functions or awaiting the script load.

See the [Understanding proxied functions](/docs/guides/script-loading#Understanding-proxied-functions) section for more information.

::code-group

```vue [Proxy Usage]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  version: '0.12.0',
  use: () => typeof window.JSConfetti !== 'undefined' && new window.JSConfetti()
})
// using the proxied function that will be called when the script is loaded
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>
```

```vue [Await Load]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { $script } = useScriptNpm({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  version: '0.12.0',
  use: () => typeof window.JSConfetti !== 'undefined' && new window.JSConfetti()
})
$script.then(({ addConfetti }) => {
  // using the real API instance
  addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
})
</script>
```

::

Congrats! You should see some emojis once the script is loaded in.

However, you'll notice that we have an issue with types here. The `addConfetti` function is not typed, so we don't get any intellisense or type checking.

### Adding types

You can use the generic from the `useScriptNpm` composable to add types to the script and add global types to the window object.

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
export interface JSConfettiApi {
  addConfetti: (options?: { emojis: string[] }) => void
}

declare global {
  interface Window {
    JSConfetti: { new (): JSConfettiApi }
  }
}

const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm<JSConfettiApi>({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  version: '0.12.0',
  use: () => typeof window.JSConfetti !== 'undefined' && new window.JSConfetti()
})
// fully typed!
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>
```

### Bonus: Event based script loading

You can delay the loading of the script by using the `trigger` option. This can be useful if you want to load the script after a certain event or time.

In this example we'll combine the [useElementScriptTrigger](/docs/api/use-element-script-trigger) composable with the `useScriptNpm` composable to load the script after a certain element is in view.

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const mouseOverEl = ref<HTMLElement>()
const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm<{ addConfetti: (options?: { emojis: string[] }) => void }>({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  version: '0.12.0',
  scriptOptions: {
    trigger: useElementScriptTrigger({ trigger: 'mouseover', el: mouseOverEl })
  }
})
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>

<template>
  <div ref="mouseOverEl">
    <h1>Hover over me to load the confetti</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

### Bonus: Bundling the script

As the script is from NPM and versioned, we can safely bundle it with our application. This will reduce the number of DNS requests needed, improving the performance of our application.

To bundle the script, you can use the `bundle` option.

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm<{ addConfetti: (options?: { emojis: string[] }) => void }>({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  version: '0.12.0',
  scriptOptions: {
    bundle: true
  }
})
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>
```

You should see the script loaded in from your apps server.
