title: Bundling
---

Bundling scripts allows you to serve third-party scripts from your own servers. This has several benefits:
- Improved security, privacy and performance for end-users.
- Bypass ad blockers and privacy extensions.

For supported scripts, it's enabled by default. When building your site it will
download any detected scripts and bundle them with your app.

You can opt out of bundling by using the `assetStrategy` option.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    defaultScriptOptions: {
      assetStrategy: null
    }
  }
})
```

If you opt-out of bundling, you can still bundle scripts individually.

```ts
useScript('https://example.com/script.js', {
  assetStrategy: 'bundle'
})
```
