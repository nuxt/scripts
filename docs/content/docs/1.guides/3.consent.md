## Background

Many third-party scripts include tracking cookies that require user consent under privacy laws. Nuxt Scripts simplifies this process with the [useConsentScriptTrigger](/docs/api/use-consent-script-trigger) composable, allowing scripts to be loaded only after receiving user consent.

## Usage

The [useConsentScriptTrigger](/docs/api/use-consent-script-trigger) composable offers flexible interaction options suitable for various scenarios.

See the [API](/docs/api/use-consent-script-trigger) docs for full details on the available options.

### Accepting as a Function

The easiest way to make use of `useConsentScriptTrigger` is by invoking the `accept` method when user consent is granted.

For an example of how you might lay out your code to handle this, see the following:

::code-group

```ts [utils/cookie.ts]
export const agreedToCookiesScriptConsent = useConsentScriptTrigger()
```

```vue [app.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
import { agreedToCookiesScriptConsent } from '#imports'

useScript('https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js', {
  trigger: agreedToCookiesScriptConsent
})
</script>
```

```vue [components/cookie-banner.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
import { agreedToCookiesScriptConsent } from '#imports'
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="agreedToCookiesScriptConsent.accept()">
    Accept Cookies
  </button>
</template>
```

::

### Accepting as a resolvable boolean

Alternatively, you can pass a reactive reference to the consent state to the `useConsentScriptTrigger` composable. This will automatically load the script when the consent state is `true`.

```ts
const agreedToCookies = ref(false)
useScript('https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js', {
  trigger: useConsentScriptTrigger({
    consent: agreedToCookies
  })
})
```

### Delaying script load after consent

There may be instances where you want to trigger the script load after a certain event, only if the user has consented.

For this you can use the `postConsentTrigger`, which shares the same API as `trigger` from the `useScript` composable.

```ts
const agreedToCookies = ref(false)
useScript('https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js', {
  trigger: useConsentScriptTrigger({
    consent: agreedToCookies,
    // load 3 seconds after consent is granted
    postConsentTrigger: new Promise<void>(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000))
  })
})
```
