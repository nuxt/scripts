### Sending Page Events

When using tracking scripts, it's common to send an event when the page changes. Due to Nuxt's head implementation being
async, the page title is not always available on route change immediately.

`useAnalyticsPageEvent` solves this by providing you with the page title and path when they change.

```ts
useAnalyticsPageEvent(({ title, path }) => {
  // triggered on route change
  gtag('event', 'page_view', {
    page_title: title,
    page_location: 'https://example.com',
    page_path: path
  })
})
