title: Global Scripts
description: Load global third-party scripts and optimize them for your Nuxt app.
---

## Background

While the `app.head` method in Nuxt Config allows for loading global scripts, it can be cumbersome and requires manual optimization.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  head: {
    script: [ { src: 'https://analytics.com/tracker.js',  async: true } ]
  }
})
```

A simpler method is now available: directly input the script URL into `scripts.globals`. You can also include optional settings to tailor the script loading process with specific optimizations in mind.

You may consider using global scripts when:
- The script isn't a supported [Registry Script](/docs/api/use-script#registry-script).
- You don't care about interacting with the API provided by the third-party script (e.g. you don't need to use `gtag` from Google Analytics).
- You are interacting with the API provided by the third-party script, but you don't care about type safety.

Otherwise, it's recommended to use [useScript](/docs/api/use-script) to load scripts in a safer way.

## Usage

The `globals` key supports strings, objects and arrays.

**Example: Load a script using just the src**

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    globals: {
      myScript: 'https://analytics.com/tracker.js',
    }
  }
})
```

**Example: Load a script while providing extra script attributes**

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    globals: {
      myScript: {
        src: 'https://example.com/script.js',
        integrity: 'sha256-abc123',
      }
    }
  }
})
```


You can optionally provide the script as an array which allows you to provide [Script Options](/docs/api/use-script#NuxtUseScriptOptions).

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    globals: {
      myScript: [
        { src: 'https://example.com/script.js' },
        // load the script as part of the hydration process instead of on idle
        { trigger: 'client' }
      ]
    }
  }
})
```

### Accessing a global script

All Nuxt Scripts are registered on the `$scripts` Nuxt App property.

For scripts registered through nuxt.config, type autocompletion is available.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const { $scripts } = useNuxtApp()
$scripts.myScript // { $script, instance }
</script>
```

## How it Works

The `globals` configuration will be used to create a virtual Nuxt plugin that loads in the script using the `useScript` composable. 

As `useScript` is being used under the hood, it's important to understand the defaults and behavior of the [useScript](/api/use-script) composable..

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    globals: {
      tracker: 'https://analytics.com/tracker.js',
    }
  }
})
```

```vue [components/Tracking.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
// This will not trigger the script to be loaded again because of the nuxt.config global script
const { track, $script } = useNuxtApp().$scripts.tracker

$script.then(() => {
  console.log('Script loaded')
})

function trackCustom() {
  track('custom_event')
}
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="trackCustom">
    Track Custom Event
  </button>
</template>
```
