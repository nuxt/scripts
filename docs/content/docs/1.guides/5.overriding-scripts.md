When working with modules that use Nuxt Script, you may want to modify the
behavior of the script. This is especially useful for
changing the asset strategy of a script as it needs to be defined statically.

To do so you can use the `overrides` module option.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    overrides: {
      // the key is either a specified key or the script src
      confetti: {
        assetStrategy: 'bundle'
      }
    }
  }
})
```
