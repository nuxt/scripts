title: Global Scripts
---

If you prefer a config based approach, you can load scripts globally by defining them in your `nuxt.config.ts`.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    globals: [
      'https://example.com/script.js',
    ]
  }
})
```

You can optionally provide the script as an array which allows you to provide script options.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    globals: [
      // script.js
      [
        { src: 'https://example.com/script.js' },
        { trigger: 'onNuxtReady' }
      ]
    ]
  }
})
```
