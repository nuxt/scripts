---

Registry scripts enhance the developer experience by simplifying the integration of third-party scripts in Nuxt Scripts.

For the list of supported registry scripts, see the [Script Registry](/scripts) list.

## Features

### 😌 Safe Initialization

Many third-party scripts require initialing some global state before loading the script, Nuxt Scripts handles this for you
in an optimized way.

### 🏎️ Fine-grain performance tuning

Each registry script has been optimized to load the script functionality in the most efficient way possible.

### 📜 Fully Typed

Handling third-party scripts usually means dealing with their API types on your own. Registry scripts alleviate this by providing predefined types, enabling code completion and type safety in your projects.

### ✅ Validating Options

Using [Valibot](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot), registry scripts automatically validate the configuration options of third-party scripts, helping you identify and resolve misconfigurations early. For instance, they check the token length for Cloudflare Web Analytics.

::code-group

```ts [Schema]
export const CloudflareWebAnalyticsOptions = object({
  /**
   * The Cloudflare Web Analytics token.
   */
  token: string([minLength(32)]),
  /**
   * Cloudflare Web Analytics enables measuring SPAs automatically by overriding the History API’s pushState function
   * and listening to the onpopstate. Hash-based router is not supported.
   *
   * @default true
   */
  spa: optional(boolean()),
})
```

```ts [Example]
useScriptCloudflareWebAnalytics({
  token: '123', // will throw an error, string is not 32 chars
})
```

::

For performance reasons, validation will only occur during development. It will be tree-shaken out of your production build.

### 🤫 Runtime Config Integration

Registry scripts can be configured through your `.env` file, allowing you to provide script options without hardcoding them in your codebase.

::code-group

```text [.env]
NUXT_SCRIPTS_CLOUDFLARE_WEB_ANALYTICS=YOUR_TOKEN
```

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    registry: {
      // loads the script
      cloudflareWebAnalytics: true,
    },
  },
  runtimeConfig: {
    public: {
      scripts: {
        cloudflareWebAnalytics: {
          // provide empty string so .env works
          token: '', // NUXT_SCRIPTS_CLOUDFLARE_WEB_ANALYTICS_TOKEN
        },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

::

## Usage

### Disabling in development

When you want to use the exposed API script in development, say calling `gtag` in a component, you want to load a mocked version
of the script, so that it will never load.

You can do this by providing a `mock` value to the registry script.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
import { isDevelopment } from 'std-env'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    registry: {
      googleAnalytics: isDevelopment
        ? 'mock' // script won't load unless manually callined load()
        : {
            id: 'YOUR_ID',
          },
    },
  },
})
```

### Using Script Options and Script Input

Registry scripts doesn't stop you from making use of the core `useScript` features, you can provide extra options to opt-in to the advanced features.

- `scriptOptions` - Additional options to pass to the script. Same as [useScript Options](/docs/api/use-script#scriptoptions).
- `scriptInput` - Additional input to pass to the script. Same as [useScript Input](/docs/api/use-script#scriptinput).

```ts
useScriptCloudflareWebAnalytics({
  token: '123',
  // HTML attributes to pass to the script element
  scriptInput: {
    'data-cf-test': 'true'
  },
  // useScript options used for advanced features
  scriptOptions: {
    trigger: new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000)),
    bundle: true,
  },
})
```

### Loading best practices

When using a registry script in multiple pages or components, it's recommended to either initialize the script in your `app.vue` or your
`nuxt.config` with the required options.

Any subsequent calls to the registry script will use the same instance of the script, not requiring any options.

::code-group

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    registry: {
      // loads the script
      fathomAnalytics: {
        site: 'SITE_ID',
      }
    }
  }
})
```

```vue [components/any-component.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const { trackGoal } = useScriptFathomAnalytics() // no options required
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="trackGoal('GOAL_ID')">
    Track Goal
  </button>
</template>
```

::

Alternatively you can wrap the registry script in a composable to allow for easier instantiation of the script.

```ts
export function useFathomAnalytics() {
  return useScriptFathomAnalytics({
    site: 'SITE_ID',
  })
}
```
