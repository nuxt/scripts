üêõ The bug
When using useScript() with the bundle: true option, the documentation implies that the script will be bundled and served from the local domain automatically ‚Äî but this does not happen.

Instead, the script is still loaded from the original external URL unless the developer manually uses proxy.src and injects their own <script> tag.

This behavior is not mentioned in the documentation and leads to confusion. Developers assume bundle: true will change the src or handle injection automatically (like Nuxt's useHead() or useSeoMeta() do).

üõ†Ô∏è To reproduce
stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt-starter-invmavzj?file=app.vue

üåà Expected behavior
Either:

bundle: true should automatically replace the src with the local bundled version, or

The documentation should clearly explain that developers must use proxy.src manually.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional context
Add a note to the API docs under bundle explaining that:

"Using bundle: true does not automatically change the script's src. You must use the src returned by useScript() if you want to load the locally bundled version."

Optional: Provide a config like inject: true to automate this behavior (similar to how useHead() works).

I have problems with this way

`



<script setup lang="ts"> const { var } = useRuntimeConfig().public; useScript({ src : `https://widgets.trustedshops.com/js/${var}.js`, defer : true, async:true, }) </script>
`

This sounds like a bug as this is what it should be doing.

Maybe also a bug with it working in dev

`

This example wouldn't;t work with the bundle option, as far as I tested bundle option only works when you have a full url without variables

This doesn't work as there is a variable interpolating

<script setup lang="ts"> 
const { var } = useRuntimeConfig().public; 

useScript({ src : `https://widgets.trustedshops.com/js/${var}.js`, defer : true, async:true, }) 
</script>
This works without the interpolation

<script setup lang="ts"> 
useScript({ src : 'https://widgets.trustedshops.com/js/example.js', defer : true, async:true, }) 
</script>
So basically as far as I know if you have a script that requires interpolation ( example different scripts per country wouldn't work )

Maybe a solution right now would be replicate the useScript with the different urls per country but that would be too much or @nuxt/scripts needs to provide a way to bundle it even if there is interpolation ( the hard thing is how nuxt scripts knows al the possibilities to generate all those different scripts )
