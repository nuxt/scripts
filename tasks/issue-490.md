üìö Is your documentation request related to a problem?
Hi, I have a multi-language app and I want to globally load a different gtag depending on the language.

I use different domains, each domain with its own language, in i18n.

Do you have any idea how I can do this? I can‚Äôt find the right solution.

thanks!

Hey @EduardoMateos,

in a vue component


// Get the country
const currentCountry = useCurrentCountry()

// Map of id to country can be done in a config file as well
const gtagPerCountry = {
'pt-pt': 'XXX',
'fr-fr': 'YYY',
...
}


const googleAnalytics = useScriptGoogleAnalytics({
id: gtagPerCountry[currentCountry]
})
Wouldn't smth like this work for you ?
