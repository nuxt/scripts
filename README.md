## Background

Loading third-party IIFE scripts using `useHead` composable is easy. However,
things start getting more complicated quickly around SSR, lazy loading, and type safety.

Nuxt Scripts was created to solve these issues and more with the goal of making third-party scripts more performant,
have better privacy and be better DX overall.

## Quick Start

To get started, simply run:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add @nuxt/scripts
```

Done! You can now start using Nuxt Scripts in your Nuxt app.
